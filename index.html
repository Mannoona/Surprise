        <p class="letter">From ben10 to the loml?
The day I saw you in the gc, I just felt the urge to get to know you. I felt that type of attraction to you — even tho I didn't know you, and I didn't know how you look. At first, we would have silly fights about genders, yet I never really got annoyed at you — even tho if it was someone else I'd have been annoyed and never wanted to talk to them. Then we just clicked, finding out that you do CS and you love horror movies — finally something we can talk about? And when Terrifier came out, we'd talk about it. The urge to get to know you got even stronger.
Then I took advantage of Zoey thinking you're cool to add you to the gc where I was active the most, to be able to talk to you more. And it worked. I started tagging you and calling you "ben10," and you'd tell me to stop, but I didn't. Then I started flirting with you, and we just stopped flirting with the others and committed that flirting to each other. We'd call each other "baby" and delete, then we went wild. And finally, we started talking more — not in dms, tho. And then the "dead gc" to get each other online and talk instead of just saying hi. We were so shy.
And God, whenever you'd join a call, I'd just go silent, cuz no matter how much I tried to gather myself, my voice would just betray me whenever I tried to talk when you were there. My heart would be thumping in my chest, and I didn't know why. I would get that rush of excitement whenever you join — yet never talk. And when we played Exposed? God, the minute you said you like me, you just gave my heart an overdose — got me grinning and kicking my feet — before I realized that it may be friendly. Meg told me I'm delulu. But I was right.
And in one of our calls, Meg tried to expose that I loveee your voice and find it attractive. And I kept saying "she's lying," knowing damn well she isn't. I was even typing in her chat, "his voice is so—" then I deleted, because I knew she'd expose me. And I muted her, and you believed me, and we both laughed.
And then, I was in denial for a short while. Me liking a MAN I don't know? But then again, you aren't just a man. You are my adorable man.
Meg made me admit to myself that I liked you. But then I wondered if you liked me back. I'd analyze everything with GPT and say, "Does he like me?" But I always stayed realistic and put a possibility of me just being delusional or you just being friendly. But the way you always texted me after arguments made me really feel like you care. And I just knew that every time after arguments, you'd text.
I would be like, "I don't wanna talk to anyone," but then "Benny sent a message" would show, and I'd forget all about ignoring people and just talk to you. And I'd want to do that back, but you were sooo chill that it was hard for you to be in arguments. I loved that you were so chill. But then you finally got into an argument, and I took advantage of it and talked to you. Felt like I'm evil, cuz who'd like arguments? But I didn't like arguments. I just liked the advantage I had — the chance of talking to you. Now I know you did the same.
Then I decided to start talking to you in dms. Three days, same time, every day. I said, "If I initiate and we talk, maybe he'll initiate too." Then I stopped texting to see if you would. You didn't in the first day, so I thought you didn't like me, so I decided that I would move on. And then I tried to ignore you in the gc or just avoid you, but I didn't.
Then I woke up in the middle of the night and saw that you texted around 4am — which made me be like, "Oh, so he noticed that I didn't text?" And I just grinned.
Then we started talking more often in dms. And God, my crush on you only grew.
And on one random night, while I was doing the usual and telling Meg that I think you may like me back, she told me to ask you. And I said, "Oh hell, nah," cuz I didn't wanna lose you. So she said she would. I tried to stop her and prayed you'd ignore her — but fortunately, you didn't.
These mins we waited till you replied were hell. I was sooo excited yet anxious. Then she sent "HE DOES," and my heart just started thumping again, and I grinned for days. Mind you, I skipped school cuz I couldn't sleep from the dopamine rush that day.
And on the same day, you sent a reel telling me I'm the prettiest girl you know. Then I gathered my courage and told you that I like you. Then we started talking more, and you'd count the hours we talked every day. Then I asked if you wanted to make it official — and you did.
Then we started dating, and you became an essential part of my day.
These months are the happiest months for me. I hope nothing ever changes that, and I hope if we ever change, we only change for the better. I love you so much.
If I start talking about what I love about you, I won't finish. Cuz I love the way you talk, the way you get me, how you make me feel — and I love your voice and face and all of you.
Who would've thought that just a simple ben10 would start all of that?
<p class="line"> Happy birthday to my favorite person on earth.</p>
And sorry for not following the "I won't write that much cuz you don't like letters.</p>
        <p class="signature">With love, Menna</p>
