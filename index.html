        <p class="letter">Today is such a special day because that's the day you were born. I'm so grateful we met.
            If I'm going to talk about all the things I love about you, I won't finish. You are such a great person 
            to be around. I love your humor, your understanding, your face, your voice, how you speak, and how you make
            me feel, and how you can change my mood from bad to great. I love how we grin while texting, and when you 
            fall asleep while we are chatting, even tho it makes me miss you.. And when you speak in that sleepy voice..
    You are adorable and sleepy... You will probably think that this is cringe but well...</p>
        <p class="line">If you liked letters I'd have written you a hundred more line</p>
        <p class="line">Happy birthday, my love. I love you so much.</p>
